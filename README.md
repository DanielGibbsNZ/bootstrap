DanielGibbsNZ's Bootstrap
=========================

This bootstrap sets up a computer for my use. It installs various configuration files, scripts, programs, utilities, and programming language packages. It can also be used to update the currently installed versions of the config files to the latest versions.

It can be run by downloading and executing the bootstrap script (`bootstrap.sh`):

	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DanielGibbsNZ/bootstrap/master/bootstrap.sh
	bash bootstrap.sh && rm bootstrap.sh

The command line options, including those for executing or skipping specific sections can be shown by running `bootstrap.sh --help`.
